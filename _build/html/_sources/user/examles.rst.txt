Usage Examples
========================

Here you'll find all sorts of information about analysing the
Caterpillar halos. If you still aren't sure what to do after reading the documentation please send an email to `Brendan
Griffen <mailto:brendan.f.griffen@gmail.com>`__. Make sure you have
setup your work environment correctly and obtained the necessary
libraries.

Loading Halo Catalogues
-----------------------------

One example combining these two modules with some general inspection
would look something like as follows:

.. code:: python

    import brendanlib.grifflib as glib
    import haloutils as htils

    # load the first 24 halos
    # (just change 14 to 11 for the lower resolution halos)

    hpaths = htils.get_paper_paths_lx(14)

    # loop through all high-resolution halos

    for hpath in hpaths:

        # strip down the path to just the halo id

        parentid = htils.get_parent_hid(hpath)

        # get the central host id of the zoom-in halo
        # parentid is named from the parent simulation 
        # the zooms have different ids

        zoomid = htils.load_zoomid(hpath)

        # Return the pandas data frame with all the halos, 
        # return mvir for example

        lastsnap = htils.get_lastsnap(hpath)
        halos = htils.load_rscat(hpath,lastsnap,verbose=True)
        mvir_host = halos.ix[zoomid]['mvir'] # units of Msol/h

        # get one specific parameter of the host at
        # z = 0 (quick version of above)

        mvir_host = htils.get_quant_zoom(hpath,'mvir') # units of Msol/h
       
        # return all halo virial masses

        all_mvir = halos['mvir'] # units of Msol/h

        # get the merger tree of the host and all its subs

        cat = htils.load_mtc(hpath,haloids=[zoomid])

        # read in every halo's merger tree

        all_trees = htils.load_mtc(hpath,indexbyrsid=True)
        tree = all_trees[zoomid] 

        # if you feed more than one id to the above 
        # it would be cat[0],cat[1] etc.

        # you can now access the main branch > try tree. then tab complete to see other functions
        mainbranch = tree.getMainBranch() 

        # we also have a short hand version:
        # mainbranch = htils.get_mainbranch(hpath) 
        # which is very fast and skips the reading of the entire progenitor tree if you don't need dit
        # see further down this page for more options
        # output the main branch virial mass

        print mainbranch['mvir'] 


As stated above, you can load a Rockstar catalogue for a given snapshot simply as:

.. code:: python

    rscat = htils.load_rscat(hpath,snapshot,verbose=True)

Once you do this however, you will have access to the following methods:

.. code:: python

     def __init__(self, dir, snap_num, version=2, sort_by='mvir', base='halos_', digits=2, AllParticles=False):
       def get_particles_from_halo(self, haloID):
           # @param haloID: id number of halo. Not its row position in matrix
           # @return: a list of particle IDs in the Halo
       def get_subhalos_from_halo(self,haloID):
           #Retrieve subhalos only one level deep.
           #Does not get sub-sub halos, etc.
       def get_subhalos_from_halos(self,haloIDs):
           #Returns an array of pandas data frames of subhalos. one data frame
           #for each host halo. returns only first level of subhalos.
       def get_subhalos_from_halos_flat(self,haloIDs):
           #Returns a flattened pandas data frame of all subhalos within
           #the hosts given by haloIDs. Returns only first level of subhalos.
       def get_hosts(self):
           # Get host halo frame only
       def get_subs(self):
           # Get subhalo frame only
       def get_all_subs_recurse(self,haloID):
           # Retrieve all subhalos: sub and sub-sub, etc. 
           # just need mask of all subhalos, then return data frame subset
       def get_all_subhalos_from_halo(self,haloID):
           # Retrieve all subhalos: sub and sub-sub, etc.
           # return pandas data frame of subhalos
       def get_all_sub_particles_from_halo(self,haloID):
           #returns int array of particle IDs belonging to all substructure
           #within host of haloID
       def get_all_particles_from_halo(self,haloID):
           #returns int array of all particles belonging to haloID
       def get_all_num_particles_from_halo(self,haloID):
           # Get the actual number of particles 'total_npart' from halo as opposed to 'npart'.
           # mainly for versions less than 7
       def get_block_from_halo(self, snapshot_dir, haloID, blockname, allparticles=True):
           # quick load a block (hdf5 block) of particles belong to halo.
           # e.g. you want particle positions for haloid = 10 (use blockname="pos")
           # this works fastest on snapshots ordered by id and requires import readsnapHDF5_greg 
       def H(self):
           #returns hubble parameter for rockstar run
       def get_most_gravbound_particles_from_halo(self,snapshot_dir, haloID):
           # Gets most bound particles just based on potential energy for specific halo ID
       def get_most_bound_particles_from_halo(self, snapshot_dir, haloID):
           # Gets most bound particles for halo based on pot. energy and kin. energy
           # if potential block does not exist, it is calculate assuming a spherical halo
       def getversion(self):
           # returns the version of rockstar the run was done within
           # this will include versions made by Alex Ji, Greg Dooley & Brendan Griffen

Here is an example of some of these in action:

.. code:: python

    # load required modules

    import haloutils as htils 
    import numpy as np

    # select Cat-1 halo

    hpaths = htils.get_paper_paths_lx(14)[0]

    # select the last snapshot (z = 0)
    snapshot = htils.get_lastsnap(hpath)

    # load rockstar id of the host halo

    zoomid = htils.load_zoomid(hpath)

    #Load Halo Catalogue

    halos = htils.load_rscat(hpath,snapshot)

    #Select host halos

    hosts = halos.get_hosts()

    #Select subhalos

    subs = halos.get_subs()

    # Get positions of subs and hosts

    print hosts[['posX','posY','posZ']]
    print subs[['posX','posY','posZ']]

    #Get particle ids from halo of interest (here it is the host)

    print halos.get_particles_from_halo(zoomid) 

    #Get virial radius of a specific halo id (in this case the host)

    print halos.ix[zoomid]['rvir'] # units of kpc/h

Loading Merger Trees
-------------------

Similarly the merger tree catalogues (once loaded) have a number of its own functions.

.. code:: python

    def getMainBranch(self, row=0):
       """
       @param row: row of the halo you want the main branch for. Defaults to row 0
       Uses getSubTree, then finds the smallest dfid that has no progenitors
       @return: all halos that are in the main branch of the halo specified by row (in a np structured array)
       """
    def getMMP(self, row):
       """
       @param row: row number (int) of halo considered
       @return: row number of the most massive parent, or None if no parent
       """
    def getNonMMPprogenitors(self,row):
       """
       return row index of all progenitors that are not the most massive
       These are all the subhalos that were destroyed in the interval
       """

These can be used in the following example:

.. code:: python

    # load required modules

    import haloutils as htils 
    import numpy as np

    # select the caterpillar halo of interest
    # based on halo id and resolution level

    hid = 1387186
    lx = 14

    hpath = htils.hid_hpath_lx(hid,lx)

    # select the last snapshot (z = 0)
    snapshot = htils.get_lastsnap(hpath)

    # load rockstar id of the host halo

    zoomid = htils.load_zoomid(hpath)

    # Load every tree (VERY slow)

    trees = htils.load_mtc(hpath)

    # Just look at the first tree
    # tree = cat[0]
    # You can access all trees via: cat[0], cat[1] etc.

    # If you want to load the tree for a particular ID from the rockstar catalogue

    trees = htils.load_mtc(haloids=[zoomid]) # in this case the host (quite slow) 
    tree = cat[0] # tree will contain all progenitors, including subhalos

    # Just say you want to index the merger tree by the z = 0 root rockstar id 
    # (i.e. the base of the tree). This is quite powerful because you might select
    # halos of interest in the rockstar catalogue then want to know, just for those
    # what their merger tree is (e.g. say you just want dwarf systems of a particular size)

    trees = htils.load_mtc(haloids=[zoomid],indexbyrsid=True) 
    tree = trees[zoomid]

    # You can just loop through rockstar ids (if you gave it more than one id above)
    # and get out the accretion histories for a small sample of trees quite quickly

    # to get the main branch

    main_branch = tree.getMainBranch()

    # print mass evolution
    for mass,scale in zip(main_branch['mvir'],main_branch['scale']):
       print "%3.2f: %3.2e" % (scale,mass)

    # output
    1.00: 2.86e+14 
    0.99: 2.89e+14 
    0.98: 2.90e+14 
    0.97: 2.90e+14 
    0.95: 2.88e+14 
    0.94: 2.86e+14 
    0.93: 2.83e+14 
    0.92: 2.80e+14 
    0.91: 2.76e+14 
    0.90: 2.73e+14 
    0.89: 2.64e+14 
    0.88: 2.47e+14 ... 

A function to find the descendent branch of any halo in merger tree
catalogue. You should use it as follows:

.. code:: python

    # get a tree of interest
    mtc = haloutils.load_zoom_mtc(hpath)
    host = mtc.Trees[0]

    # make a dictionary that maps ids to rows
    desc_map = host.get_desc_map()

    # get the descendent branch.
    desc_branch = host.getDescBranch(row, desc_map)

    # similarly for main branches, you can use a dictionary that speeds up the
    # getMainBranch call substantially.
    mmp_map = host.get_mmp_map()
    main_branch = host.getMainBranch(row, mmp_map)

    # you can get the branches without making the map as below, but they will be much slower.
    # only faster if you use ~ < 10 calls to the function.
    desc_branch = host.getDescBranch(row)
    main_branch = host.getMainBranch(row)

Loading Particle Data
-----------------------

If you want the Gadget header:

.. code:: python


    # get the first halo in the catalogue

    hpaths = htils.get_paper_paths_lx(14)[0]

    # read its Gadget header
    header = htils.get_halo_header(hpath)

    # header contains the typical Gadget info
    header.boxsize        header.massarr        header.omegaL
    header.cooling        header.metals         header.redshift
    header.double         header.nall           header.sfr
    header.feedback       header.nall_highword  header.stellar_age
    header.filenum        header.npart          header.time
    header.hubble         header.omega0 

Be sure to divide the relevant quantities (pos, rvir etc.) by
``header.hubble``. See the Gadget section in the sidebar for more
information on the header and block types available.

If you wanted to get the postions of all the particles for a specific
halo (or any block).

.. code:: python

    pos = htils.load_partblock(hpath,zoomid,"POS ") # units Mpc/h
    # "VEL ", "ID  ", "MASS" etc. also work (notice the space)
    # check readsnapshots/readsnapHDF5.py for the other block names 
    # you can call in the caterpillar modules

    print pos*1000. # kpc/h

    # output
    [ 32085.45117188  57312.79296875  44314.35546875]
    [ 27002.18554688  10062.73242188   9899.70019531]
    [ 26711.08789062   9560.22460938  10165.18847656]
    [ 49757.3515625   21470.00195312   6461.90917969]
    ...

If you want to read in the entire block, use the following:

.. code:: python

    import haloutils as htils

    hid = 1387186
    lx = 14
    hpath = htils.hid_hpath_lx(hid,lx)

    pos = htils.load_partblock(hpath,319,"POS ")
    mass = htils.load_partblock(hpath,319,"MASS")

Note that the mass block will have different values depending on how
many layers of refinement there are for that zoom in simulation. If you
use this code on a parent simulation it will be an array of length N all
of the same value because there is only one particle type.

If you wanted just the ids for a selection of particle ids:

.. code:: python

    pos = htils.load_partblock(hpath,zoomid,"POS ",partids=[listofids]) # units Mpc/h
