Rockstar
========================

Overview
--------

Rockstar identifies dark matter halos, substructure, and tidal features
in phase space.The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement
of friends-of-friends groups in six dimensions, which allows for robust
(grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of
substructure; as such, it is named Rockstar (Robust Overdensity
Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). The
"consistent trees" algorithm for generating merger trees and halo
catalogs explicitly ensures consistency of halo properties (mass,
position, velocity, radius) across timesteps. The algorithm has
demonstrated the ability to increase both the completeness (through
inserting otherwise missing halos) and purity (through removing spurious
objects) of both merger trees and halo catalogs. In addition, the method
is able to robustly measure the self-consistency of halo finders; it is
the first to directly measure the uncertainties in halo positions, halo
velocities, and the halo mass function for a given halo finder based on
actual cosmological simulations.

The code's paper can be found `here <http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4372>`__.

Rockstar and Iterative Unbinding
--------------------------------

Rockstar is able to find any overdensity in 6D phase space including
both halos and streams. To distinguish gravitationally bound halos from
other phase space structures, Rockstar performs a single-pass energy
calculation to determine which particles are gravitationally bound to
the halo. Over-densities where at least 50% of the mass is
gravitationally bound are considered halos, with the exact fraction a
tuneable parameter ``unbound_threshold`` of the algorithm Behroozi et
al. (2013).

This definition is generally very effective at identifying halos and
subhalos -- but it fails in two important situations. First, if a
subhalo is experiencing significant tidal stripping, the 50% cutoff can
remove a subhalo from the catalog that should actually exist. We have
found that changing the cutoff can recover the missing subhalos, but the
best value of the cutoff is not easily determined. Second, Rockstar is
occasionally *too* effective at finding substructure in our high
resolution simulations. In particular, it often finds velocity
substructures in the cores of our halos that are clearly spurious based
on their mass accretion histories and density profiles. Importantly,
these two issues do not just affect low mass subhalos, but they can also
add or remove halos with \\(V\_{max}\\) > 25 km/s.

Both of these problems can be alleviated by applying an iterative
unbinding procedure. We have implemented such an iterative unbinding
procedure within Rockstar. At each iteration, we remove particles whose
kinetic energy exceeds the potential energy from other particles in that
iteration. The potential is computed with the Rockstar Barnes-Hut method
(see Appendix B of Behroozi et al. (2013). We iterate the unbinding
until we obtain a self-bound set of particles. Halos are only considered
resolved if they contain at least 20 self-bound particles. All halo
properties are then computed as usual, but with the self-bound particles
instead of the one-pass bound particles. The iterative unbinding
recovers the missing subhalos and removes most but not all of the
spurious subhalos. Across 13 of our *Caterpillar* halos, we recover 52
halos with subhalo masses above 108 \\(M\_:raw-latex:`\odot`\\) which
would have otherwise been lost using the conventional Rockstar. See
`Griffen et al.
(2015) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1509.01255>`__

Rockstar Full Particles Binary
------------------------------

Summary of changes for full particle binary output. 8/19/2014 (Alex Ji)

Alex added a Rockstar option to be able to output in binary all of the
particle ids belonging to each halo. This means there is no need to
recursively get particles from subhalos in ``RSDataReader``. It also
means particles from subhalo fof groups that were deemed unbound or too
small, and hence not previously written out, are now correctly written
out to the halo they should belong to.

Usage: Compiling When compiling Rockstar, use the command % make
full\_particle\_binary This automatically compiles with HDF5 also.

Config File
~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Rockstar config file, specify
``FULL_PARTICLE_BINARY = num processors`` to write out full binary files
This should be set to the same as ``NUM_WRITERS``. It could be less, but
I don't see any reason for that. Also specify
``DELETE_BINARY_OUTPUT_AFTER_FINISHED = 1`` This deletes the standard
.bin files. The new files contain all of the same info as the old .bin
files, so they are just a waste of space.

Reading Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside ``haloutils.py`` we use ``RSDataReader.py`` version 10. There is
now a new parameter called ``total_npart`` which specifies the total
number of particles belonging to a halo, including substructure.

-  ``get_particles_from_halo()`` will now return all particles from a
   halo.
-  ``get_all_particles_from_halo()`` returns exactly the same thing
   except when using old version of rockstar.

he first ``npart`` particles from any given halo are exactly the same
particles you would have gotten in the original Rockstar output.

-  the files now end with the extension ``.fullbin`` instead of ``.bin``

They are ~10% larger due to the extra particles in version 10.

Changes to Rockstar code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files Modified:
``config.template.h Makefile halo.h properties.c meta_io.c io_internal.c io_internal.h``
In config file, will need to specify
``FULL_PARTICLE_BINARY = num processors`` to write out full binary files
This config option is now added to config.template.h and by default set
to 0. When compiling, specify the option:
``$ make full_particle_binary`` defines the flag
``FULL_PARTICLE_BINARY_FLAG`` This will compile a version such that the
halo struct has an extra parameter total\_num\_p, found in ``halo.h``.
It will also compile with hdf5 since this is the case we most often
want. ``total_num_p`` is assigned in ``properties.c`` in the function
``calc_additional_halo_props()`` This corresponds to the total number of
particles belonging to the halo, including particles assigned to fof
groups that were not printed out (for being unbound, too small, etc.)
The extra parameter for each halo needs to be read in with
``RSDataReader.py`` version 7. it is named 'total\_npart' for now. In
the file ``meta_io.c``, in the function output\_halos() Added another if
statement that calls ``output_full_particles_binary()`` to print data as
we want it. Function called only if ``FULL_PARTICLE_BINARY > 0`` as
specified in config file. Wrote ``output_full_particles_binary()`` to
``io_internal.c``. It is just like ``output_binary()`` except it uses a
recursive function, ``print_child_particles_binary()`` to print all of
the particles, not just ``num_p`` of them. Declared
``output_full_particles_binary()`` in ``io_internal.h``

``print_child_particles_binary()`` in ``io_internal.c`` is my function
which is a modification of ``print_child_particles()`` to recursively
trace child halos and print their particles ids to binary, not ascii.
``print_child_particles_binary()`` did not need to be declared in any
header file. Just written in file before function that calls it. Output
files will now be named ``halos_x.y.fullbin`` x is the snap number y is
the chunk number. Ranges from 0 to FULL\_PARTICLES\_BINARY-1

In the halo output, ``p_start`` corresponds to the starting position in
the particle array p of the processor it is on where particles are
belonging to that halo. We write this out as ``numstart`` in
``RSDataReader``. It was not used before, and now shouldn't ever be
used.

At the moment, ``cat.total_particles`` will not be truly accurate. It
will refer to the sum of npart of every halo. It would be easy to change
this to refer to the sum of ``total_npart`` for each halo in
``RSDataReader``. I don't see a good use for ``cat.total_particles``
either way though. The binary header information will specify
num\_particles as the sum of ``npart``, or ``num_p``. Changing this is a
bad idea, as it will break other parts of how Rockstar is run. To
specify a different particle count, such as number of unique particles
written to file, or sum of ``total_num_p``, would require an extra
parameter to the ``struct binary_output_header``, or to change
``num_particles`` just in the output. I don't see a good use for this
right now.

Another note: Files are not written out in order to keep halo ids
written out in order. Ex: halos.0.bin might write halos 0 – 250
``halos.1.bin`` would write out halos 1001-1250 and ``halos.2.bin``
would write out halos 251-500. This means the unsorted data[i] array in
``RSDataReader`` will not always have the property that ``data[i]`` is
the halo of ``id = i``.

Running Rockstar (i.e. the same version as in Caterpillar).
-----------------------------------------------------------

So you have a Gadget simulation output and you want to run Rockstar on
it.

First you'll need a working version of Rockstar which works with the
read modules that we will be using later. The version we used for
Rockstar can be found `here <https://bitbucket.org/alexji/rockstar>`__.
The output (when put int he appropriate folders, will work with out
modules. Be sure to also get ``consistent-trees-0.9.9.2`` to connect it
all together. consistent-trees isn't the latest version as were were a
victum of the times; we had to go with one version, for all time.

1. Go to your Rockstar-hdf5 directory and run "make with\_hdf5". If it
   breaks, you need to point to the hdf5 libraries on your system.

.. code:: bash

    HDF5_FLAGS = -DH5_USE_16_API -lhdf5 -DENABLE_HDF5 -I/bigbang/data/bgriffen/lib/hdf5-1.8.10/include -L/bigbang/data/bgriffen/lib/hdf5-1.8.10/lib -lhdf5 -lz

2. Go to your consistent-trees directory and run "make all".

3. Make a folder inside your Rockstar-hdf5/ directory called "cfgs"
   where you will put your cfg files.

The parent simulation configuration file (parent.cfg) for the MIT halos
looks like:

.. code:: bash

    PARALLEL_IO = 1
    PARALLEL_IO_SERVER_INTERFACE = "ib0"
    FORK_READERS_FROM_WRITERS = 1
    FORK_PROCESSORS_PER_MACHINE = 16
    NUM_WRITERS = 128
    INBASE = /bigbang/data/AnnaGroup/caterpillar/parent/gL100X10/outputs
    FILENAME = snapdir_<snap>/snap_<snap>.<block>.hdf5 
    NUM_BLOCKS = 256                       
    FILE_FORMAT = "AREPO"            
    FULL_PARTICLE_CHUNKS = 1             
    OUTBASE=/bigbang/data/AnnaGroup/caterpillar/parent/gL100X10/Rockstar
    AREPO_LENGTH_CONVERSION=1
    AREPO_MASS_CONVERSION=1e+10
    SNAPSHOT_NAMES=/bigbang/data/AnnaGroup/caterpillar/parent/gL100X10/Rockstar/snapparent.dat
    FORCE_RES=0.002
    OUTPUT_FORMAT = "BOTH"

You'll have to modify this to suite your needs. This is suited for
infiniband using 16 cores per machine and
``NUM_WRITERS = Nnodes*Ncores`` being used. ``NUM_BLOCKS`` is also for
the number of input files for a given snapshot which you specified for
Gadget. You can leave it as ``AREPO`` as this is just default for using
the HDF5 snapshots. You just need to make sure you set the ``LENGTH``
and ``MASS`` conversions correctly. The ones above are native for
``P-Gadget3``. Be also sure to get ``FORCE_RES`` or force softening
correct. Here we use 1/40 times the mean inter-particle separation or
(1/40)\*boxwidth/(np)^(1/3) which in our case is 100/2^10/40 ~ 0.002. If
you have the space, I would suggest leaving OUTPUT\_FORMAT to be BOTH.
You can clean up the files you don't want later. Snapshot names is just
a file listing the snapshot names ``000,001,002 ...`` up to the number
of snaps, 127 in this case.

4. You will then have to submit the Rockstar run to the cluster. For a
   cluster like Stampede or other SLURM build systems you can adapt the
   following:

.. code:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH -o parentrock.o%j
    #SBATCH -e parentrock.e%j
    #SBATCH -t 48:00:00
    #SBATCH -p normal
    #SBATCH --mail-user=bgriffen@mit.edu
    #SBATCH -J parentrock
    #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
    #SBATCH -n 512

    module load hdf5

    rsdir=/home1/02670/bgriffen/Rockstar
    exe=/home1/02670/bgriffen/Rockstar/rockstar

    cd $rsdir
    outdir=/scratch/02670/bgriffen/gL100X10/Rockstar

    $exe -c $rsdir/cfgs/parent.cfg &
    #$exe -c $outdir/restart.cfg & #only use for restarting the run, comment line above.
    cd $outdir
    perl -e 'sleep 1 while (!(-e "auto-rockstar.cfg"))'
    srun -n 512 $exe -c auto-rockstar.cfg

If you are running on PBS, please email `Brendan
Griffen <brendan.f.griffen@gmail.com>`__ for a PBS version which works
just as well.
