Analysis Modules
========================

-  Read the `cluster
   information <https://github.com/caterpillarproject/wiki/wiki/Cluster-Information>`__.

-  Keep in mind: ``bigbang.mit.edu`` (our group box) is where you want
   to do your analysis, access data etc. and ``antares.mit.edu`` is the
   login node for the cluster for the whole Institute. Remember:
   analysis = bigbang, jobs = antares! See Compute Cluster Information
   in the sidebar for more detail on these two machines and how the data
   is actually distributed.

-  Get our modules from the `Caterpillar Project github
   page <https://github.com/caterpillarproject>`__. These include the
   following two critical libraries:

.. code:: bash

    git@github.com:caterpillarproject/modules.git
    git@github.com:caterpillarproject/analysis.git

You can obtain them in the following way (ensure you are in the
directory you want them to be placed):

.. code:: bash

    > git clone git@github.com:caterpillarproject/modules.git

(sorry we dont have any support for IDL or Matlab at this time - please
share any you develop!)

-  Add the following to your ``.cshrc`` file.

.. code:: bash

    setenv PYTHONPATH /path/to/modules:$PYTHONPATH

-  Install the `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`__
   python distribution and be sure to run ``conda update`` periodically.
   You can also

-  You will also need ``asciitable``, ``h5py`` and ``pandas`` to make
   full use of our module package. You can install some of these
   packages with Anaconda by ``> conda install pandas``, for example. If
   that fails, simply do ``> pip install pandas`` etc. to install each
   of these. When you open ``ipython``, you should be able to import
   each of these - please make sure you can before importing the
   modules!

You're now ready to roll!
