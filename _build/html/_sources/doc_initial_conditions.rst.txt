Initial Conditions
========================

Overview
--------

We use the multi-scale cosmological initial conditions creator MUSIC.
MUSIC is a computer program to generate nested grid initial conditions
for high-resolution "zoom" cosmological simulations. A detailed
description of the algorithms can be found in Hahn & Abel (2011). You
can download the user's guide
`here <https://bitbucket.org/ohahn/music/downloads/MUSIC_Users_Guide.pdf>`__
or obtain a copy of the code
`here <https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~hahn/MUSIC/>`__. Any questions
should be directed to `Brendan Griffen <brendan.f.griffen@gmail.com>`__
and then if that fails, `Oliver Hahn <hahn@phys.ethz.ch>`__.

Parameters
----------

These are the parameter files which were used to generate the initial
coditions for the *Caterpillar* project. We adopt the raw Planck (2013)
cosmology and do not use 2nd order lagrangian perturbation theory. The
`user
guide <https://bitbucket.org/ohahn/music/downloads/MUSIC_Users_Guide.pdf>`__
contains all the information required to understand the following
parameter files. Within each simulation directory, there is a file named
``OUTPUTmusic`` which gives the log of the construction of the initial
conditions.

Parent Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First we constructed a parent simulation of sufficient size to include
thousands of Milky Way sized systems but also of sufficient resolution
to construct good lagrangian volumes. We decided on ~10,000 particles
per Milky Way-sized host and a 100 Mpc/h volume. Our ``level_max`` is 10
below, which means our parent simulation's effective resolution is
(210)3 = (1024)3 (i.e. a particle mass of 8.72 x 107
\\(M\_:raw-latex:`\odot`/h\\).

If you have access to the MIT cluster (``bigbang.mit.edu``), you can
access the parent simulation data here:
``/bigbang/data/AnnaGroup/caterpillar/parent/gL100X10/``. Within this
folder you'll find the following file (within ``ics/``):

Zoom Simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each simulation folder has a configuration file for MUSIC (e.g.
``H1079897_EX_Z127_P7_LN7_LX14_O4_NV4.conf``) which was used to
construct the initial conditions.

There are a few things to note about the zoom-in paramter files when
compared to the parent volume parameter file. First is we now specify a
``region_point_file`` which defines the x,y,z (normalized to the box
width) of the particles to be resampled. We have added the parameter
``hipadding`` which our own modification to allow for expanded regions.
1.05, for example, represents an expanded ellipsoid (by 5%). See Section
2.3 of `Griffen et al.
(2015) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1509.01255>`__
for a more detailed description of these geometries and their impact on
contamination.

We also draw the reader's attention to the seed values. Note that we do
not set the seed values for any level lower than the parent volume (10)
which makes MUSIC smooth out any levels lower than 10. The seed values
at 11 are simply the halo numbers and then each level higher scales by a
factor of 2 of this original number. This was required because the ICs
were generated through our automatic pipeline and each simulation needs
unique values to seed the random noise field. The ``levelmin_TF`` is
also set to be the same as the parent volume (10). The padding and
overlap parameters are the same for all simulations.
